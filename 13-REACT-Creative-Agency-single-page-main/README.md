- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Swiper.js - For Slider


### Continued development

This project helped me understand better how to position elements and pseudoelements with position relative / absolute without breaking the layout, also learnt that styled components props always have to go camelCase
